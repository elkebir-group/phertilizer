## Phertilizer: growing a clonal tree from ultra-low coverage single-cell DNA sequencing data of tumors


![Overview of Phertilizer](overview.png)
Phertilizer infers a clonal tree with SNV and CNA genotypes given ultra-low coverage single-cell sequencing data.
(a) A tumor is composed of groups of cells, or clones with distinct genotypes.
(b) Ultra-low coverage single-cell DNA seequencing produces total read counts and variant read countsfor n cells and m SNV loci, and read-depth ratios for the same cells for an input set of bins.
(c) Phertilizer infers a cell clustering, SNV genotypes, CNA genotypes and a clonal tree  with maximum posterior probability.
